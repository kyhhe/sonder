## Problem

Student mental health is often overlooked. According to the ACHC 2016 student health survey, 41.5% of students reported "[feeling] that things were hopeless", 55.3% feeling "overwhelming anxiety", 33.5% feeling "so depressed that it was difficult to function", and 5.9% who seriously considered suicide in the last 12 months (American College Health Association, 2017, p.13). These feelings can be linked to high academic pressure, financial stressors and future uncertainties during an age range with the highest risk of mental disorders. 

While everyday stressors are normal, a student struggling with managing stress has an increased risk of developing mental health disorders. Poor mental health has been associated with poorer academic performance and worse learning outcomes. These students are less motivated to engage in class, have higher drop-out rates, and are more likely to isolate themselves from their peers.

On the contrary, students who learn to manage their stress and develop strategies to support their mental health have greater resiliency when faced with hardships. They are more motivated and demonstrate higher academic performance. As such, many universities have pushed out mental health help systems for students through peer or professional counselling. However,  despite these resources, student mental health remains a challenge. Consistency is one of the key components of building good mental health habits, so some students may find it difficult to start and continue counselling. Other recommendations include daily check-ins and exercises; however, most focus on stress relief with little encouragement on keeping track of a person’s mental status.
