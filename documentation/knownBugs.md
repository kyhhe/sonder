# Known Bugs
### 1. Full Screen Mode does not Persist
*Description*: When the user clicks the fullscreen button, 
the application will correctly expand to full screen. However,
as soon as the user clicks any button or interacts with any other
UI element, the window exits full screen adn returns to its original size.

### 2. Advanced Time does not Persist After Restart
*Description*: If the user advances the in-program clock using F1, and then closes
and reopens the game, the date resets to the real-world current date, instead of 
retaining the advanced date. This can be seen on the date display on the main
screen.
